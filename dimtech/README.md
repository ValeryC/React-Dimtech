I create different folder style in different part of the folder . i try to organise component with different categorie of folder (page, container, siderbar, menu... big component who contain single component ) and i let the simple component who get called on Components folder.
I don't know if it is the best way to organize folder component, but if you have a better idea let me know it would be great. 


Just want to say that it's been a while that i used react. I am more familiar with Vuejs. 
So i had to learn a lot about hooks state. Cause at the beginning i wrote all my component with class, and i realize how simple it was to use hook function. This work give me a lot of tips for the future. So thank you, i hope you will enjoy my work.
So if you need anything, let me know and i will answer you as soon as i can.

Cheers!!
