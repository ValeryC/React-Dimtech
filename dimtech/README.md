I create contexts folder to access current user anywhere in our application

For firebase api key if you had any trouble to login ask me cause i create an .env.local. (.gitignore)

I used react hook form library cause when you see the performance of the other on https://react-hook-form.com/
you will see that   

Design on page Signup http://localhost:3000/Signup:  (Step1.js component) I think that the checkbox should be erase cause you create an account for the first time so you don't need to keep log.
