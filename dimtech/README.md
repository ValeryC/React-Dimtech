###Front done for all this page

http://localhost:3000

http://localhost:3000/ForgetPass  (need to fix component ../container/ForgottenPass.js to display the right component error)

http://localhost:3000/Signup

http://localhost:3000/Signup2 (need to get the info value of user)

http://localhost:3000/Signup3 (need to get the info value of user)

http://localhost:3000/SignupEnd

I create contexts folder to access current user anywhere in our application

For firebase api key if you had any trouble to login ask me cause i create an .env.local. (.gitignore)

I used react hook form library cause when you see the performance of the other library on https://react-hook-form.com/
you will see that react hook is more quick than the other (Reduce Rendering, Faster Mounting)


Design on page Signup http://localhost:3000/Signup:  (Step1.js component) I think that the checkbox should be erase cause you create an account for the first time so you don't need to keep log. 

temp mail you can generate quick temporary mail to test login with firebase
