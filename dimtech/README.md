For firebase api key if you had any trouble to login ask me cause i create an .env.local. (.gitignore)

I used react hook form library cause when you see the performance of the other library on https://react-hook-form.com/
you will see that react hook is more quick than the other (Reduce Rendering, Faster Mounting)


Design on page Signup http://localhost:3000/Signup:  (Step1.js component) I think that the checkbox should be erase cause you create an account for the first time so you don't need to keep log. 

You can generate quick temporary mail to test login with firebase

Sorry i just realize that i have to use redux or mobx...
So i use my cloud firestore, easy to launch and to manipulate for the backend. (simple and free)
Message error has been treated.


Just want to say that it's been a while that i used react. It was really really long time ago, i am more familiar with Vuejs. 
So i had to learn a lot about hooks state. Cause at the beginning i wrote all my component with class, and i realize how simple it is to use hook function. This work give me a lot of tips for the future. So thank you, i hope you will enjoy my work.
So if you need anything, let me know and i will try my best to answer you.

Cheers!!
